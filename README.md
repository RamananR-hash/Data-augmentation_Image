Data augmentation_Image_Scaling_Fliping_Rotate



Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning to increase the size and diversity of a training dataset by creating new synthetic data points from the original data. It is a common technique used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of machine learning models.

The process of data augmentation involves applying a set of transformations to the original data, such as rotation, flipping,  scaling,. These transformations create new samples that are similar but not identical to the original data. For example, rotating an image of a cat by 10 degrees will produce a new image of the same cat, but from a slightly different angle.


you need to install 
1)opencv 
2)imutils


it wwill have a 3 files for 3 different augmentation

after running first it will ask for base class folder from the class it will take the image and create a new folder and store the agumented data
